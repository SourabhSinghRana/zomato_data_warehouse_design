# üöÄ Excited to share my recent experimental project: designing a Zomato/Swiggy Data Warehouse! üçΩÔ∏è

I recently embarked on an exciting journey into the realm of data warehousing, taking on the challenge of designing a Data Warehouse for Zomato/Swiggy, one of the leading online food delivery platforms. This project has provided me with invaluable hands-on experience, allowing me to apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world scenario.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the Data Warehouse Design that I have crafted for this data warehouse. Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated as I strive to enhance and optimize the design.

As I delved into this project, I was driven by the aim of enabling data-driven decision-making within the food tech industry. By building a comprehensive data warehouse, I aimed to empower Zomato/Swiggy with the tools and insights necessary to make informed business decisions and optimize their operations.

If you have any suggestions or ideas on how to further improve this data warehouse design, please feel free to share. I am keen to learn from the expertise of the LinkedIn community!
